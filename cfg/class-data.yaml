    association studies (GWAS), which search the genome for small variations, called
    single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that occur more frequently in people with
    a particular disease than in people without the disease. In our research, we conducted
    a meta-analysis on  five different summary statistics done on Type two diabetes.
    We analyzed over 15 million different alleles to find that there are certain regions
    of the genome that contribute more to Type two diabetes than others. Specifically,
    our study found from the data we used that certain regions of chromosome 10, 11,
    and 6 are associated with T2Ds. Some specific genes we found that seemed to be
    correlated with T2Ds due to their very low p-values are TCF7l2, CDKAL1, and KCNQ1.
    In particular, TCF712 is a transcription factor influencing the transcription
    of several genes, thereby exerting a large variety of functions within the cell
    and it was named a prime suspect in causing type 2 diabetes. CDKAL1 is a protein
    coding gene and is somewhat correlated with type 2 diabetes. KCNQ1 is a protein
    that supports the creation of potassium channels and is also somewhat believed
    to be correlated with type 2 diabetes.

    of malware apps has become increasingly important. We performed a static code
    analysis to get a better understanding of which APIs in the code are responsible
    for the malicious behaviour. Using relationships between APIs and apps we create
    a heterogeneous information network. Different metapaths (kernels) in the network
    can help us predict the category of malware that an app belongs to. We considered
    5 broad categories of malware - benign, trojan, ransom, backdoor and adware. Different
    kernels were good at classifying different categories of malware and hence we
    decided to use a multi kernel model to get the best of all kernels. In cyber-security
    understanding your model is crucial. Imagine the ramifications of a hacker understanding
    your model better than you. To better understand our model, we studied our model
    on two levels - app level, API level. For the API level we looked at the correlation
    between APIs and the classification result. This helped us recognise which APIs
    were important. Further, we developed a ranking algorithm to identify APIs that
    were unique to a specific category of malware. We then used APIs that were unique
    to benign to see if we could trick our model into predicting malware apps as benign.
    To understand how specific apps affected our classification output, we analysed
    the SVM weights of our model and looked into how apps cluster together using tSNE.

Many hackers targeted Android applications by disseminating malwares, posing serious threats to users. Historically, mobile security products such as Norton and Lookout, are heavily relied upon as major defense against such threats. Recently, many machine learning based methods have been invented for malware detection. A successful one of them is creating features from a Heterogeneous Information Network (HinDroid). However, it is confined in such a way that it ignores more comprehensive information which can be extracted from graph representation. In this project, we will explore different meta-paths and incorporate various graph embedding methods in the task of malware prediction. We propose to build upon our previous work in HinDroid replication, more specifically we will attempt to use deep learning graph embedding techniques. The success of this project will not only be determined by the performance of our final model but more importantly the evaluation of different graph embedding methods and further reasoning on the result.

    \ project is to quantify ragas in a way that could then be used to build a raga\
    \ identification tool. By quantifying the features of a raga, we were able to\
    \ build a raga identification classifier. We can then classify an audio clip into\
    \ one of the 10 broader ragas, known as \u200Bthaats. \u200BThis tool is able\
    \ to \u201Clisten\u201D to an audio clip and identify the raga that the song is\
    \ set to. It mimics what seasoned listeners of Indian classical music do already:\
    \ try to identify the raga while listening to a composition. In extracting features\
    \ from audio clips we aggregated from our personal collection, we found that each\
    \ raga has quantifiable differences that distinguish them from one another. These\
    \ differences include a variance in the occurrences/frequencies of each note (all\
    \ audio clips were standardized to a scale set in C) as well as the varying patterns\
    \ within the songs themselves (quantified in the form of bigram and trigram occurrences).\
    \ These quantifiable differences were integral to our classification of each raga.\
    \ Their distinct features enabled us to accurately classify an audio clip into\
    \ its raga. By applying the frequency/occurrence of each note, as well as the\
    \ patterns that each raga produces, as features to our classification model, we\
    \ were able to generate accurate classifications given an audio clip."

  abstract: Image Restoration has evolved with the use of Neural Networks and research
    has left us wondering what they can learn from data. I chose to investigate how
    Deep Generative Adversarial Networks can reconstruct World War II images from
    the process of degradation. Using a collection of World War II images, the network
    learns how to effectively restore selected regions of the image. Through training
    with smaller similar subsets to the target, we could achieve approximately similar
    results than training on the entire population, leading to better use of domain
    adaptation of GANS. The results show that finer selective masking performs better
    inpainting results than block selections. With more domain knowledge, GANs can
    perform closer approximate reconstructions of images.

  abstract: "The Super Bowl is annually the most watched television program, which\
    \ means companies are willing to spend up to $5.6 million for a mere 30 seconds\
    \ of the nation\u2019s attention. In parallel to the financial evidence, the commercials\
    \ have been described anecdotally as \u201Cambitious\u201D, \u201Cnotorious\u201D\
    , and \u201Cmust-have guests [to the main event]\u201D. The cultural phenomenon\
    \ of the Super Bowl commercial is well-recognized. Thus, the cultural analytics\
    \ question becomes how modern data analysis techniques can help us to better decipher\
    \ what makes these commercials so special and generally abnormal. To generate\
    \ these results, we analyzed quantitative differences between television commercials\
    \ that air during the Super Bowl and those that air any other time. As a branch\
    \ of cultural analytics, this project seeks to determine the capability of data\
    \ processing to validate or otherwise opine on the social consensus regarding\
    \ the commercials. Our project will be more focused on the social dynamics of\
    \ the commercials. We have analyzed a decade worth of Super Bowl commercials,\
    \ comparing them to counterparts in visual and auditory attributes. Using techniques\
    \ such as shot detection, spectral transformations, and text analysis, this project\
    \ offers a complete discussion of the concept of attention-getting in advertising\
    \ from an analytical viewpoint."

  abstract: "The objective of the project was to find trends among different genres\
    \ of book covers, and create a classifier that would categorize a book based on\
    \ only its cover. We used OpenLibrary\u2019s Subject API to download 500 images\
    \ of each genre category, crime, horror, fantasy, romance, and science, totalling\
    \ 2500 images that we worked with. Color statistics were calculated and graphed\
    \ on a scatter plot. Based on graphs which visualized the basic color statistics\
    \ of the book covers, we were unable to find trends among each genre. We later\
    \ generated CNN feature vectors of each image, and graphed it using UMAP, and\
    \ it didn\u2019t show any clusters as well. We also do a comparison of RGB histograms\
    \ for each cover to find its most similar book cover."
