# wiki-capstone
Public repository for DSC 180B senior capstone project exploring racial bias in Oscars and Golden Globes Award Shows.

How to Run:
  This project consists of two parts: data collection and creating visuals. Both "test-project" and "full-project" targets
  will run both parts. 

  Targets:
  1. "clean" : Removes any test data created and removes any visualizations created. Does not remove full data because that is needed for the visualizations.
  2. "test-project": Runs the data collection process for only years 1934-1935. It also creates visuals using data from years 1934-2008.
  3. "full-project": Runs the data collection process for all years 1934- 2008. It also creates visuals using this data. (Delete "data/" folder before running this target)
