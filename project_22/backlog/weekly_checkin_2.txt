Weekly Check-in 2 (4/14):

1. Tasks Attempted:
	- Making code for generating artifical datasets
	- Defining how to represent continous data.
	- Performing EDA on our medical dataset

2. Completed:
	- Everything

3. Obstacles:
	- We found a high amount of missing data witin our medical dataset
	- The medical dataset is large, so we anticipate needing to make our code very scalable.

4. Coming Week:
	– Generate Heterogenous Graphs (Udai) 
	– Train baselines Models (Wesley)
		∗ perform tests over a subset of generated datasets
	– Clean real dataset and transform in a usable format (Shinu)
	– Stretch Goal: Train/Evaluate Hindroid Model using our data (everyone)
