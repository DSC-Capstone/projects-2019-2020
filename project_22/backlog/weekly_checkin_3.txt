Attempted Tasks:
	– Train baselines Models (Wesley)
	– Clean real dataset and transform in a usable format (Shinu)
	– Generate Heterogenous Graphs (Udai)

Completed:
	- Train Baseline Models (100%)
	- Create Heterogenous Graphs (50%)
	- Clean dataset (50%)

Difficulties:
	- We found that our medical dataset, even without cleaning achieved high performance with the baseline.
	- With minimal effort on a Naive Bayes classifier, passing in the columns as features resulted in very high accuracy.
	- We expected the baseline model to perform poorly because of the heavy inbalance of the dataset, but the F1-score is high, at 0.97.
	- Because of this, we are somewhat questioning our data source and/or how reasonable our approach of using a graph is for this task.

Tasks for coming week:
	- Finishing code to convert a dataset from tabular form to a heterogenous graph (Udai)
	- Implementing Hindroid model on the medical dataset & new dataset (Udai & Wesley)
	- Finding a new dataset & performing EDA on that (Shinu)
	- Running Baselines on new dataset (Wesley)
