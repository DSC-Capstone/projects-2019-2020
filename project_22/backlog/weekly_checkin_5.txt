Tasks attempted:
	- create Hindroid model for smaller datasets (Udai & Wesley)
	- convert larger dataset to a graph (Shinu)

Tasks completed:
	- implemented node2vec for smaller datasets (80% done)
	- convert large dataset to a graph (20%)

Difficulties:
	- node2vec needs some debugging, but it's almost there.
	- the large dataset conversion to a graph looks to be computationally expensive.

Attempting Next Week:
	- finish node2vec implementation, training, and testing on smaller datasets (Udai)
	- convert large dataset to graph (Wesley)
	- make the template for visualization (Shinu)
	- finish visualization (whole group)
