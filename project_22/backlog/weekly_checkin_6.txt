Tasks attempted:
	- finish node2vec implementation, training, and testing on smaller datasets (Udai)
	- convert large dataset to graph (Wesley)
	- make the template for visualization (Shinu)
	- finish visualization (whole group)

Tasks completed:
	- finish node2vec implementation (100%)
	- testing on smaller datasets (50%)
	- convert large dataset to a graph (50%)
	- visualization work (100%)

Difficulties:
	- node2vec hyperparameters need to be played around with and tested for performance issues
	- the large dataset conversion to a graph looks to be computationally expensive.

Attempting Next Week:
	- finishing node2vec on smaller datasets (Wesley and Udai)
	- finish making big graph (Shinu)
	- work on rough draft of final report (whole group)
